using python in bjam file
=========================
 
 In the site-config.jam file we can specify 
 
    using python ;
    
This will determine the default python from $PATH.
If there several python versions, then the python required must be added
to the $PATH first. The python must include the devel packages. 
As the headers in these packages is used by boost python.
    
using python
     :  # version
     :  # cmd-or-prefix
     :  # includes
     :  # libraries
     :  # condition
     ;

By using a specific version, it means that the unit tests, will use the
same specific version. 

However we did not want to hard code the version of python.
As that would restrict install for the general case.
Is is assumed that the Autoconf tools will  determine the correct
python version. We current only support python 2.5->2.7


Linux  32
===========
# By using a specific version we don't need to update $PATH,
# when python tests invoked from scripts

# Not sure how to access python version, hence defined a project wide constant variable
# This is used during installation
python_version = [ os.environ PYTHON_VERSION ] ;
python_version default = 2.7 ; # if PYTHON_VERSION not set, use this default
constant PYTHON_VERSION : $(python_version) ;

using python
     : $(python_version)                          # version
     : /usr/local/apps/python/2.7.2-01/bin/python # cmd-or-prefix
     :                                            # includes
     :                                            # libraries
     :                                            # condition
     ;
 

AIX Power6
===========
using python
     : 2.5                             # version
     : /usr/local/python64/bin/python  # cmd-or-prefix
     : /usr/local/include/python2.5 /usr/local/python64/include/python2.5/ # includes  
     : # libraries
     : # condition
     ;
     
Now update to python 2.7
using python : 2.7 ;
