LazyTextEdit 
================================================
LazyTextEdit is a Qt based text editor that lazily loads data from disk when
necessary.

It tries to keep memory usage as low as possible and only stores chunks of data
that have been modified. Its APIs resembles that of QText(Edit|Document|Cursor). 
It supports basic formatting options using TextSections and SyntaxHighlighter.

LazyTextEdit is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

Some of the source code was modified for inclusion in ecFlowUI.
