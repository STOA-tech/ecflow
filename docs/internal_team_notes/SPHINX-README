SPHINX
======
The documentation is generated. It relies on sphinx-build being available on the command line.
Also in order to document the Python api. Conf.py has been altered so that
we have added path to ecflow extension( i.e ecflow.so)

   sys.path.insert(0,os.getcwd() + "/../../Pyext/ecflow")   

However ecflow.so relies on boost python.
This is typically done as a hard coded path in ecflow.so. 
This hard coded path refers to the release area.
i.e ECFLOW_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR

Hence we need an existing install of ecflow.
This can be bypassed by using LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to dir' 
where boost python resides. 

Note: When changing boost versions, the links may not be correct.
i.e Pyext/ecflow.so -> link to ECFLOW_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR/boost python 1.45
    However when upgrading to boost 1.47 this will not be correct
    until the first install.
Again use LD_LIBRARY_PATH set path to correct boost version/python.



Use the following to generate the documentation:

# cd Doc/online  
# make clean; make html

The generated documentation can then be viewed in a web browser
by opening the file:
 
  Doc/tutorial/_build/html/index.html
  
The ecflow tar script will automatically generate the tutorial
so that there does not have to be a dependency on sphinx-build
on platforms other then linux

Intranet
========
The address for review in the intra net is::
     
   http://intra.ecmwf.int/metapps/manuals/ecflow
   
When the tutorial has been changed locally it can be updated to web server using::

   sitecopy -u ecflow

Latest update:

There was then a further problem.

Avi had reinitialised the site (probably) and this resulted in the
site not being normally update-able.

To fix this:

      sitecopy -k -u ecflow
      sitecopy -c ecflow

Documenting ecflow extension
----------------------------
ecflow python extension uses boost python for the binding between C++ and Python and sphinx for document generation.
When sphinx generates the ecflow API documentation it uses introspection to search for documentation in the python code. 
It happens that boost overrides some python introspection API for functions and methods which sphinx expects to have. 
Therefore you should see many warnings of type:
     (WARNING/2) error while formatting arguments for ecflow.ZombieAttr.zombie_type: arg is not a Python function
 
Do not worry since sphinx is able to generate the proper documentation.
