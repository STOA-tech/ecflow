Debugging Suite definition
////////////////////////////

There are two ways in which ecFlow helps you in debugging your suite definition.

* simulation - will simulate the dynamic behaviour of a suite definition in python( with the same behaviour as the server) Script
* generation - live running of the suite definition in the server, by automatically generating the task scripts.

These mechanisms do not require any scripts(.ecf files) and let you
concentrate on the debugging the behaviour of your suite.
