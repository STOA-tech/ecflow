ecFlow variables
================

| We already saw that ecFlow has some :term:`variable`'s, like ECF_HOME. 
| There are three kinds of variables:

* The variables that are used by :term:`ecFlow`, like ECF_HOME.
* | The variables that are defined by the user. 
  | They should **not** start with "ECF". 
  | It is good practice to name these variables with capital letters. 
* | The variables that are generated by ecFlow, and that you can use in 
  | your jobs, like ECF_DATE which contains the date of the suite.

Ecf Script
----------

In the previous example, we have copied the file :file:`t1.ecf` to the file :file:`t2.ecf`.

| Edit those two files so they call the unix sleep command with a :term:`variable` 
| called SLEEP as a parameter

::

   %include <head.h>
   echo "I will now sleep for %SLEEP% seconds" 
   sleep %SLEEP% 
   %include <tail.h>
   
Text

Then add the :term:`variable` to the :term:`suite definition`::

   # Definition of the suite test.
   suite test
      edit ECF_INCLUDE "$HOME/course"   # replace '$HOME' with the path to your home directory
      edit ECF_HOME    "$HOME/course"
      family f1
         task t1
            edit SLEEP 20 
         task t2
            edit SLEEP 20 
      endfamily
   endsuite 
   
Python
------

.. literalinclude:: src/ecf-variables.py


**What to do:**

#. Do the modifications
#. Replace the :term:`suite`
#. Watch in :term:`ecflowview`. 
   You should see the tasks with a :term:`status` :term:`active` for 20 seconds
