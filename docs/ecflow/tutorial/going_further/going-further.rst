**Going Further**
=================

We will now try to build a more complex :term:`suite` by introducing one by one various ecFlow functionalities. 

We will add more :term:`task`'s and learn how to group them into families. 

We will also learn to define :term:`dependencies` between tasks. 

And then we will learn how we can use ecFlow to control when tasks run.
