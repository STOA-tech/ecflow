Server load panel
/////////////////

The **Server load** tab in an Info panel shows some important statistics
about how the actual server is used. When clicking this tab first the
**server log file** is fetched (it is either accessed locally or
transferred via the network) then the file contents is parsed to build
and display the statistics.

Server load statistics
======================

The server load is estimated by the number of requests/commands sent to
the server within a given period. The server load statistics are based
on this measure and tries to estimate the contribution from the
differentÂ  ecFlow suites and users. ecFlow distinguishes two kinds of
command:

-  child commands: e.g. ::

    chd:label

-  user commands: e.g. ::
  
    --alter delete inlimit

Most of the commands contain a path so the **suite** can be extracted
from them. If the suite is not available a suite name **<no suite>** is
assigned to the command in the server load statistics.

.. note::

    Requests related to state changes and errors are not taken account 
    for the server load statistics.                                    

Total charts
============

The initial view shows the **total charts** with 3 graphs showing the
total number of requests sent from **all the suites**:

-  Child + User requests: contains the total number of child and user
   requests

-  Child requests: contains the total number of child requests

-  User requests: contains the total number of user requests

The actual contribution from a given suite is displayed in the sidebar
(see the percentage value next the suite name). By clicking on suite in
the sidebar the suite specific graphs are added to the charts.

Other charts
============

The **Other charts** tab contains some more refined statistics with 4
different chart types:

Command graph per suite
-----------------------

It shows how the different **commands are used for a given suite**. The
sidebar contains two tabs: one listing the suites and another listing
the commands. The view displays **one chart per each suite** and there
is a another chart showing the statistics for all the suites (it always
appears at the top). By default the command used the most is selected.

Suite graph per command
-----------------------

It shows how the different **suites contribute to a given command**. The
sidebar contains two tabs: one listing the suites and another listing
the commands. The view displays **one chart per each command** and there
is a another chart showing the statistics for all the commands (it
always appears at the top). By default the suite contributing the most
is selected.

Inspecting older log files
==========================

By default the Server load panel fetches the current log file. To work
with other (e.g. older) log files switch to the **Archived log** mode :

and load a single (or multiple) log file(s) using the file load button:
