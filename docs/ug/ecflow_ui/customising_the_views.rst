Customising the views
/////////////////////

ecFlowUI offers many ways to view your suites, including options that
mimic the deprecated ecflowview interface.

Customising the tree view
=========================

From the Preferences menu (Tools > Preferences), go to the
**Appearance** section and then the **Tree view** tab to access the
display options.

The option with the biggest impact on the view is **Tree layout style**.

The default, **Standard**, shows a classic tree view. It uses more
vertical space, but less horizontal space. The option
**Compact** displays the first child on the same row as its parent. This
saves vertical space, but takes more room horizontally. In this view,
double-click or use the middle mouse button to expand or collapse a tree
node.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Standard layout
     - Compact layout

          :height: 1.63483in


The next big decision is whether to display the node names inside our
outside their status rectangle (option: **Node rendering style**). The
above examples show the node names outside the boxes, the following
screenshots show the names inside the status boxes:


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Separate text and status rectangle
     - Text in status rectangle

   * - .. image:: /_static/ecflow_ui/customising_the_views/image4.png

        :height: 2.11889in

In this mode, the text can be harder to read, depending on the colours
chosen. These colours are completely configurable from the **Status**
tab in the Preferences dialogue.

To help identify at a glance whether a node is a suite, family or task,
there is an option to display the node type in the tree:

   :width: 2.26042in
   :height: 2.60417in

.. image:: /_static/ecflow_ui/customising_the_views/image9.png
   :width: 1.97917in
   :height: 1.5153in


There are plenty of other options in the **Appearance** section, and
also complete control over the fonts in the **Fonts** section - try them
out and give ecFlowUI the look you want!
