Through the rest of this document, 'ECF' will be used interchangeably with ecFlow. Any references to the server, client or GUI, refer to ecFlow server, client and GUI

A **concept** is a name used in this document to describe an idea. A **variable** is used a lot throughout this document. A **node** represents a task, family, suite, or equivalent when it does not matter which we are talking about.

Extracts from script or definition files look like this # This is in a file and this is important in this file some other lines

Colours are also used to highlight the status of a node, so if node **/x/y/z** is active, it would look like **/x/y/z**.
