Using ecFlow
////////////

To use ecFlow you need to carry out a few steps.

Firstly you need an ecFlow server running.

Next, you need to write a suite definition that shows how your various
tasks run and interact. You also need to write your ecFlow
tasks/scripts.

Finally, your suite definition is "loaded" onto an ecFLow server and
your suite is started as required and monitored via a GUI

The process is described with the associated `ecFlow online course <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/ECFLOW/Tutorial>`__.
