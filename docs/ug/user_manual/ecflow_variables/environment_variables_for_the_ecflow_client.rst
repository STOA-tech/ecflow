Environment variables for the ecFlow client
///////////////////////////////////////////


Some of these variables must be set and exported before any of the
**ecflow_client** commands are executed. Since the script/job can call
**ecflow_client**, then typically they are all set in an include file in
the header of the task so that all tasks would have them correctly set.

For a full list of environment variables used by ecflow_client please
see the :ref:`Glossary`.
