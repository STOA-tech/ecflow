Add an event
============

Sometimes waiting for the completion of a task is not good enough. If a task is producing several results, another task may start as soon as the first results are ready. For that, ecFlow introduces the concept of :term:`event`'s. 

An :term:`event` is a message that a task will report to :term:`ecflow_server` while it is running. Events have names and a :term:`task` can set several of them.

Ecf Script
----------

We will create new tasks (t3, t4) that will be triggered by the  events emitted in task t2. 

Create the :term:`ecf script` for t3 and t4 by copying t1.
    
To notify :term:`ecflow_server`, the task (**t2** in the example below) must call :term:`ecflow_client` --event which is one of the :term:`child command`'s

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Amend $HOME/course/test/f1/t2.ecf

   %include <head.h>
   echo "I will now sleep for %SLEEP% seconds"
   sleep %SLEEP%
   ecflow_client --event a       # Set the first event 
   sleep %SLEEP%                 # Sleep a bit more 
   ecflow_client --event b       # Set the second event 
   sleep %SLEEP%                 # A last nap... 
   %include <tail.h>

   # Definition of the suite test.
   suite test
      edit ECF_INCLUDE "$HOME/course"  # replace '$HOME' with the path to your home directory
      edit ECF_HOME    "$HOME/course"
      family f1
        edit SLEEP 20
        task t1
        task t2
            trigger t1 eq complete
            event a 
            event b 
        task t3 
            trigger t2:a 
        task t4 
            trigger t2:b 
      endfamily
   endsuite

Python

**What to do**

#. Update :file:`test.def` **or** :file:`test.py`
#. Edit :file:`t2.ecf` to call ``ecflow_client --event``
#. Copy :file:`t1.ecf` to :file:`t3.ecf` and :file:`t4.ecf`
#. Replace the :term:`suite`.

   | Python: ``python3 test.py ; python3 client.py``
   | Text: ``ecflow_client --suspend=/test ;  ecflow_client --replace=/test test.def``

#. Observe the tasks in :term:`ecflow_ui`.
#. See the triggers by selecting **t2/t3** and clicking on the Triggers tab
