Welcome to ecFlow's documentation
====================================

.. warning::

  This documentation is still work in progress and can only be regarded as a **draft**.

*ecFlow* is a client/server workflow package that enables users to run a large number of programs (with dependencies on each other and on time) in a controlled environment. It provides reasonable tolerance for hardware and software failures, combined with restart capabilities. It is used at ECMWF to run all our operational suites across a range of platforms.
